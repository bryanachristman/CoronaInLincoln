Report #9: Project Process Narrative

Iterative interactions with the modular course structure, the various tools, and the local environment shaped the process of building this project and repeatedly shifted my sense of scale, providing me with a nuanced understanding of the effects of the pandemic on my community. The modular structure of the course led me to think about DH concepts of making and interpreting; then, with those concepts in mind, I observed my local environment; finally, I was challenged to instantiate my thoughts and observations by evaluating and using digital tools. This process was repeated first at the level of campus, which helped me think about my experience as a student. Then it was repeated at the level of downtown Lincoln, which helped me think about my experience as a consumer and a member of the greater Lincoln community. Finally, this process was repeated on a much broader and more abstract level that encompassed both the history of the local environment and the future of my digital project.

This process of iteration also shaped how I incorporated the different reports into the final website. Over the course of the three versions of the website, I found myself both repeating the same tasks as before and considering the site as a whole from a new angle. As more content was added to my site, I was forced to consider new ways of organizing and presenting that information in a cohesive structure that could be easily navigated. Engaging with other studentsâ€™ projects and receiving feedback on my own provided me additional insight into the experience of visiting and navigating a website, which I incorporated into the final iteration of my website. As a result my project reflects both the structure of the course and my particular experience working with DH concepts and methods, observing the local environment as affected by the pandemic, and interacting with my classmates.
